Hi Everyone!
I am/was using this repo as an online backup for my dissertation code. I am conducing a research into machine learning algorithms for NEC (Necrotising Enterocolitis) classification task. Feel free to use my code with acknowledgement, have a wonderful day :)

Files:
1. ExperimentN - Deployable models to be sent to a HPC
2. custom_dl_functions - custom dataloader functions allowing for easy customisability of CheXpert dataset
3. model_training_engine - functions specifically for training the model
